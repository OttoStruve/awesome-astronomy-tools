## Tools

* [ClipMenu](http://www.clipmenu.com) -- This tool maintains a history of your clipboard, so that you can paste old snippets of text, images, URLs, etc. (stefano)
* [z](https://github.com/rupa/z) -- A shell command to jump around directories. z learns your most used directories and lets you cd to them by only specifying a piece of the name, e.g. z sys will cd to ~/Projects/Systemic2 on my machine. (stefano)
* [GNU Parallel](http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) -- Runs jobs in parallel using one or more computers from the command line. (stefano)
* [Period04](https://www.univie.ac.at/tops/period04/) -- Fourier Transform software suite for Fourier analysis of astronomical data (full FTs). Ask me if you're interested in command line (batch file) capabilities and/or a Python wrapper. (Keaton)

## Editors

* [Emacs](http://www.emacsformacosx.com) -- The ultimate editor nirvana. (stefano)
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) -- A graphical editor with a lot of built-in features (Kevin)
* [pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) -- An interactive development environment (IDE) for Python. (Kevin)
* [rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com) -- An IDE for R with lots of build-in features. (Emma)

## Data Analysis

* [Data Science at the command line](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/#tools) -- A useful list of commands that can help with working with data. (stefano)
* [wxMaxima](http://andrejv.github.io/wxmaxima/index.html) -- A free alternative to Mathematica. (stefano)
* [TOPCAT](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/) -- An interactive data analysis and plotting tool. (Yi-Kuan)
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) -- A convenience layer on top of numpy arrays. Also great for database operations (Kevin)

  
## Plotting

* [Matplotlib Gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) Matplotlib is the basis for all python plotting. Here's a gallery of plots for when you know what you want, but not how to make it. (Jacob)
* [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) Python visualization library based on matplotlib for attractive graphics (gully)
* [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) Quick and dirty plotting package. Tough to make publication quality plots, but makes decent plots fast (Kevin)
*  [D3.js](http://d3js.org) Awesome in browser figures! (gully)
* [Coyote IDL Gallery](http://www.idlcoyote.com/gallery/) Examples of helpful IDL plotting routines from David Fanning, the IDL whisperer (Natalie)

## Programming

* [Markwardt IDL Library](http://www.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/) - Some useful IDL procedures that are publicly available (jeff)
* [Homegrown IDL Routines by John Johnson](http://astro.berkeley.edu/~johnjohn/idl.html) - Another page of useful IDL procedures (jeff)
* [Ureka Astronomy Software Package](http://ssb.stsci.edu/ureka/) - Finally a pain-free way to install IRAF, PyRAF, and much more (Keaton)
* [Coyote IDL Library](http://www.idlcoyote.com/documents/programs.php#COYOTE_LIBRARY_DOWNLOAD) - IDL as it should work, especially with regard to plotting. Lots of capabilities (Natalie)

## Git and GitHub

* [Git prompt](https://gist.github.com/stefano-meschiari/ca163cd91c63492928fb) - Get the status and branch name of the git repository inside your prompt. (stefano)
* [Git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) - A tool to structure branching.
* [Git completion](https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion/wiki/Install-Bash-git-completion) - Autocomplete git commands/branches/files on the command line.

## Web

* [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) - Converts C/C++/Fortran code into JavaScript, so that the code can run hosted in the browser. (stefano)
* [Wakari](https://wakari.io) - Host iPython notebooks on the Web. (stefano)
